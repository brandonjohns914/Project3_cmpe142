Read me 1) Purpose of this project The purpose of this project is to write a C program that creates a pipe and forks a child process. The parent of the child process sends the message on his side of the pipe. The message is ÒI am your daddy!Ó and my name is <pid-of the parent-process>\n.Ó the child process should print this to stdout verbatim. The parent then blocs the reading on the pipe from the child. Because the child is blocked the child writes back to its parent though its side of the pipe stating Òdaddy my name is <pid-of-the-child>Ó. The parent should receive this message form the child stdout. The parent needs to wait for the child to exit so it does not create zombies or orphans. 2) Name of the source codesMain.c 3) Name of executable and explanation Find where main.c is saved on your computer. Open terminal. Cd <wherever> then gcc main.c. next run ./a.out. this runs the program
